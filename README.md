# Space Invaders

This project is a recreation of the classic Space Invaders game using C++ and Raylib. The player controls a spaceship that can move left and right and shoot lasers to destroy incoming aliens. The game keeps track of the player's score, high score, and current level.

## Why This Project?

I created this Space Invaders game to:
1. Learn and Practice Game Development: Developing this project allowed me to dive deep into game development concepts using C++ and Raylib. As someone who is still advancing their skills in C++, this project-based learning experience was an excellent opportunity to understand how games handle rendering, physics, and user input.
2. Enhance Problem-Solving Skills: By tackling the various challenges involved in cloning a popular game, I improved my problem-solving skills and gained experience in debugging and optimizing code.
3. Experiment with Game Mechanics: This project provided a fun way to experiment with game mechanics and understand their impact on the player's experience. Adjustments and tweaks to gameplay elements were a key part of the learning process.
4. Encourage Contributions and Customization: The project is designed to be easily extendable. For example, it includes basic functionality but leaves room for additional features like power-ups or new enemy types. I encourage others to contribute by adding their own enhancements and features.
5. Showcase My Skills: This project serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my skills in C++ programming, game development, and my ability to complete a project from start to finish.
